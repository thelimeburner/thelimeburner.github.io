Hardware virtualization and operating system level virtualization are two prominent technologies that enable this. Containers, which use OS virtualization, have recently surged in interest and deployment. In this paper, we study the differences between the two virtualization technologies. We compare containers and virtual machines in large data center environments along the dimensions of performance, manageability and software development.We evaluate the performance differences caused by the different virtualization technologies in data center environments where multiple applications are running on the same servers (multi-tenancy). Our results show that co-located applications can cause performance interference, and the degree of interference is higher in the case of containers for certain types of workloads. We also evaluate differences in the management frameworks which control deployment and orchestration of containers and VMs. We show how the different capabilities exposed by the two virtualization technologies can affect the management and development of applications. Lastly, we evaluate novel approaches which combine hardware and OS virtualization.","tags":["Virtualization","Containers","Performance Eval"],"title":"Containers and Virtual Machines at Scale A Comparative Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucas Chaufournier","Prateek Sharma","Franck Le","Erich Nahum","Prashant Shenoy","Don Towsley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1506830400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550588352,"objectID":"aa0b0d3c8b9b884b16219ed00b4740df","permalink":"/publication/fast-migrations/","publishdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/fast-migrations/","section":"publication","summary":"Edge clouds are emerging as a popular paradigm of computation. In edge clouds, computation and storage can be distributed across a large number of locations, allowing applications to be hosted at the edge of the network close to the end-users. Virtual machine live migration is a key mechanism which enables applications to be nimble and nomadic as they respond to changing user locations and workload. However, VM live migration in edge clouds poses a number of challenges. Migrating VMs between geographically separate locations over slow wide-area network links results in large migration times and high unavailability of the application. This is due to network reconfiguration delays as user traffic is redirected to the newly migrated location. In this paper, we propose the use of multi-path TCP to both improve VM migration time and network transparency of applications. We evaluate our approach in a commercial public cloud environment and an emulated lab based edge cloud testbed using a variety of network conditions and show that our approach can reduce migration times by up to 2X while virtually eliminating downtimes for most applications.","tags":["Virtualization","MPTCP","Edge Computing"],"title":"Fast Transparent Virtual Machine Migration in Distributed Edge Clouds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucas Chaufournier"," Ahmed Ali-Eldin","Prateek Sharma","Don Towsley","Prashant Shenoy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1506830400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550588352,"objectID":"39068079f4d186db8c02e4efe81985d6","permalink":"/publication/mptcp/","publishdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mptcp/","section":"publication","summary":"Todayâ€™s cloud data centers host a wide range of applications including data analytics, batch processing, and interactive processing.These applications require high throughput, low latency, and high reliability from the network. Satisfying these requirements in the face of dynamically varying network conditions remains a challenging problem. Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP) is a recently proposed IETF extension to TCP that divides a conventional TCP flow into multiple subflows so as to utilize multiple paths over the network. Despite the theoretical and practical benefits of MPTCP, its effectiveness for cloud applications and environments remains unclear as there has been little work to quantify the benefits of MPTCP for real cloud applications. We present a broad empirical study of the effectiveness and feasibility of MPTCP for data center and cloud applications, under different network conditions. Our results show that while MPTCP provides useful bandwidth aggregation, congestion avoidance, and improved resiliency for some cloud applications, these benefits do not apply uniformly across applications, especially in cloud settings.","tags":["MPTCP","Performance Eval"],"title":"Performance Evaluation of Multi-Path TCP: For Data Center and Cloud Workloads","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n  Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.
